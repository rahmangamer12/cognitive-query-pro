    Loads a CSS file using a path relative to the project's root directory.
    This is the most reliable method for Streamlit apps.
    
    How it works:
    1. `Path.cwd()` gets the current working directory, which is the project root
       when you run `streamlit run main.py`.
    2. We then join this root path with the relative path to our CSS file.

    project_root = Path.cwd()
    
    # Construct the full path to the CSS file
    # This will be something like 'D:/Agentic Ai/Project 1/ui/static/styles.css'
